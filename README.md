## Project Overview

By putting into practice the technical aspects of JavaScript we will intertwine the creation of a dynamic webpage using data analytics and visualization. Strengthening our knowledge of the use of arrays, loops and iterations we dive into the connection of the coding language that JavaScript offers to enhance HTML. With the vast amount of data available to us, we include customizable filters that will allow us to make the webpage dynamic. In other words, these filters are recording different events (clicks) that are happening to our website and produce different outcomes when these elements are entered.  Furthermore, While the syntax changes the concept and outcomes of the different functions remain the same. We also learned to differentiate Pythons ``for loop`` with forEach JavaScript’s loop. Finally, using Bootstrap we customize and equip our webpage with different tables that allow users to interact with the page’s visualizations.

Have you ever wondered how many sightings of UFOs are recorded? – You saw a very strange light seamlessly disappear into the night in a strange way? Did you imagine it or could there be a record of a similar experience of someone somewhere? Look no further, this page is for you!
Our team helped Dana build this webpage to access such records and we have made this page in a way that is easy for you to narrow down your search for it.

Within this website, the user can find out about specific dates, cities, and even the shape of that Unidentified-Flying-Object, thanks to the filters that have been incorporated into our code. We have also made this website follow our theme! In a mysterious dark background holds a page with all the data gathered ready to be displayed once a criteria is chosen.

## Results

There is a very helpful article introducing the website to our users, giving a glimpse to what they might find in it. 
With an enticing title, we welcome everyone to start their searching journey and find out if what they saw in the sky that fateful night was likely to be a UFO.
